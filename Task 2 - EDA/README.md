# Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns, detect missing values, and visualize relationships using charts and graphs.

## 📦 Dataset
[Titanic Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. Loaded and viewed the Titanic dataset
2. Checked for null/missing values
3. Cleaned missing data
4. Generated summary statistics
5. Visualized:
   - Age distribution
   - Boxplot by class
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Survival by sex
   - Pairplot

## 📈 Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate.
- Younger passengers had better survival odds.
- First-class passengers survived more than third-class.
